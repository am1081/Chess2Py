Chess2Py
========
I made this game as a learning exersise to improve my Python.
Move commands are in the following format: x1y1x2y2. x1y1 refers to the coordinates of the piece you want to move. x2y2 is coordinates of the target square.

What isn't included (yet):
- Detecting if a player is in check
- Piece promotion
- Castling
